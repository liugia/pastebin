# Pokémon Heartgold Nuzlocke Rules
These are rules for a hardcore Pokémon Heartgold Nuzlocke that will be completed on https://twitch.tv/liugia

<b>Start date: November 22nd, 2023</b>

## General Rules
1) Can only catch the first Pokémon seen on each route/cave/town.
2) All Pokémon must have nicknames.
3) If a Pokémon faints, it is dead and no longer usable. Graveyard will be in the PC.
4) No items allowed during battle, no exceptions. The only items allowed to be used during battle are held items. No duplicate items.
5) Pokémon can level up in battle but must not be above the ace's level before battling the gym leader.
6) Battle must be in Set mode.
7) No breeding allowed.
8) HM slaves are allowed but cannot be used in battle or leveled at all.
9) Once a gym has been entered, you cannot leave it until complete.

<ins>Blind Playthrough</ins> - No looking at the documentation (only looking at documentation for ace pokemon levels). \
<ins>Shiny Clause</ins> - Given that a shiny Pokémon is RANDOMLY found, you may catch it. The exception to this rule is the Lake of Rage-- the in-world shiny Gyarados counts as an encounter. \
<ins>Dupe Clause</ins>  - If the first encounter is a Pokémon that's already been caught, it can be skipped, and the next Pokémon found will be deemed the "first encounter".
